/**
 * Supports {@link PatienceDiff} by finding unique but common elements.
 *
 * This index object is constructed once for each region being considered by the
 * main {@link PatienceDiff} algorithm, which really means its once for each
 * recursive step. Each index instance processes a fixed sized region from the
 * sequences, and during recursion the region is split into two smaller segments
 * and processed again.
 *
 * Index instances from a higher level invocation message some state into a
 * lower level invocation by passing the {@link #nCommon} array from the higher
 * invocation into the two sub-steps as {@link #pCommon}. This permits some
 * matching work that was already done in the higher invocation to be reused in
 * the sub-step and can save a lot of time when element equality is expensive.
 *
 * @param <S>
 *            type of sequence the scanner will scan.
