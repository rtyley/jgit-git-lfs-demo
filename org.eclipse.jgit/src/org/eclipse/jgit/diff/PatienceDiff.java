/**
 * An implementation of the patience difference algorithm.
 *
 * This implementation was derived by using the 4 rules that are outlined in
 * Bram Cohen's <a href="http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/73318.html">blog</a>.
 *
 * Because this algorithm requires finding a unique common point to center the
 * longest common subsequence around, input sequences which have no unique
 * elements create a degenerate Edit that simply replaces all of one sequence
 * with all of the other sequence. For many source code files and other human
 * maintained text, this isn't likely to occur. When it does occur, it can be
 * easier to read the resulting large-scale replace than to navigate through a
 * lot of slices of common-but-not-unique lines, like curly braces on lone
 * lines, or XML close tags. Consequently this algorithm is willing to create a
 * degenerate Edit in the worst case, in exchange for what may still be
 * perceived to be an easier to read patch script.
 *
 * In a nutshell, the implementation defines an Edit that replaces all of
 * sequence {@code a} with all of {@code b}. This Edit is reduced and/or split
 * to remove common elements, until only Edits spanning non-common elements
 * remain. Those {@link Edit}s are the differences.
 *
 * A slightly more detailed description of the implementation is:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Define an Edit that spans the entire two sequences. This edit replaces
 * all of {@code a} with all of {@code b}.</li>
 *
 * <li>Shrink the Edit by shifting the starting points later in the sequence to
 * skip over any elements that are common between {@code a} and {@code b}.
 * Likewise shift the ending points earlier in the sequence to skip any trailing
 * elements that are common. The first and last element of the edit are now not
 * common, however there may be common content within the interior of the Edit
 * that hasn't been discovered yet.</li>
 *
 * <li>Find unique elements within the Edit region that are in both sequences.
 * This is currently accomplished by hashing the elements and merging them
 * through a custom hash table in {@link PatienceDiffIndex}.</li>
 *
 * <li>Order the common unique elements by their position within {@code b}.</li>
 *
 * <li>For each unique element, stretch an Edit around it in both directions,
 * consuming neighboring elements that are common to both sequences. Select the
 * longest such Edit out of the unique element list. During this stretching,
 * some subsequent unique elements may be consumed into an earlier's common
 * Edit. This means not all unique elements are evaluated.</li>
 *
 * <li>Split the Edit region at the longest common edit. Because step 2 shrank
 * the initial region, there must be at least one element before, and at least
 * one element after the split.</li>
 *
 * <li>Recurse on the before and after split points, starting from step 3. Step
 * 2 doesn't need to be done again because any common part was already removed
 * by the prior step 2 or 5.</li>
 * </ol>
